# graph-merging-thesis
This contains random bits of LaTeX and other fun files which together form my thesis.

The file "evo.tex" is where all the fun is happening; the rest of the files are external figures which are linked in, usually in the format PNG for rasterized graphics or PDF for vector graphics. The PDF files themselves are usually based on SVG files generated by the Graph Merging Library, which may or may not be included here as well.
